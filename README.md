# 📝 Programming II – PartialExam-POO-2025-02-A

## Context
You are working in a software company.  
The manager gives you a UML diagram and asks you to implement the system in **Java** using good practices.

## UML Diagram
👉 [View UML Diagram](https://www.rapidcharts.ai/editor/f6a4ffd7-7b94-4fc5-9923-e1e365cd0862/View)

## Instructions
1. Implement the class exactly as in the UML diagram.  
2. All attributes must be **private**.  
3. Use **encapsulation** (getters and setters if necessary).  
4. Implement **constructors** as shown in the diagram.  
5. Implement all methods correctly.  
6. In a `Main` class, create at least **two objects** and test all the methods.

## Reflection Question
Write a short paragraph (5–8 sentences):  
👉 *What new knowledge or skills did you have to learn by yourself to complete this exam? Give an example.*

*(Hints: you can talk about UML, encapsulation, constructors, or understanding the exam in English.)*

--- The tools used in my case were a little help from the audio-visual method, mainly YouTube, which helped me with comprehension and understanding beyond the classes I already knew. It also taught me to review the code more carefully to avoid errors. I used private classes and corrected errors in the main because it was my main weakness, but now I understand them and have improved my skills. There may have been times when I got distracted, but I was able to overcome myself and break my limits, and I managed to finish the code.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **UML implementation in Java (encapsulation, constructors, methods):** 50%  
- **Objects created and tested in `Main`:** 20%  
- **Reflection:** 30%
